I'm currently assisting in the Forest Ecosystems and Global Change lab at UCLA by making a 
pipeline to analyze spectroscopy data from the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON). 
A lot of my work involved identifying sites that had an interesting or abnormal distribution of 
traits that we could sample during fieldwork. Traits we are looking at are things that might be affected
by drought and fire, such as leaf mass per area, equivalent water thickness, Phosphorus, Nitrogen, etc. 
I've also recently been working on making a process to clip data by land cover type so that traits 
can be better analyzed by their distribution between grasslands vs. forests vs. barren lands (etc). 
I also had the opportunity to participate in fieldwork for a week at the San Joaquin Experimental Range, 
where I learned a lot about how all this data is collected and used to calibrate the spectroscopy data from NEON.
Most of my code so far has been written in Python.
