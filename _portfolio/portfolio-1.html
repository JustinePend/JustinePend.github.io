<p>I'm currently assisting in the Forest Ecosystems and Global Change lab at UCLA by making a 
    pipeline to analyze spectroscopy data from the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON).
    I've been working on extracting spectroscopic data for each pixel in the trees that we sampled 
    during fieldwork, which will be used in a PLSR (partial least-squares regression) algorithm
    to extract functional traits. </p>

<p>A lot of my work also involved identifying sites that had an interesting or abnormal distribution of 
    traits that we could sample during fieldwork. Traits we are looking at are things that might be affected
    by drought and fire, such as leaf mass per area, equivalent water thickness, Phosphorus, Nitrogen, etc. 
    I had the opportunity to participate in fieldwork for a week at the San Joaquin Experimental Range, 
    where I learned a lot about how all this data is collected and used to calibrate the spectroscopy data from
    NEON.</p>

<p>Most of my code so far has been written in Python. </p>
