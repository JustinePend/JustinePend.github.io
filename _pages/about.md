I'm a second-year Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) Major at UCLA (with a planned Conservation Biology Minor). I'm interested in the intersection of environmental science and technology, and I have extensive experience in robotics, remote sensing, and microcontrollers. 

Most of my experience comes from projects within university research labs, as well as robotics and some personal projects. I'm always interested in trying something out of my comfort zone *(such as this website! I've never used Ruby before)*.
