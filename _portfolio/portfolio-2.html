I interned at CID Bioscience during the summer of 2023. CID is a small biotech company based in
Camas, WA, which designs and produces instruments for use in scientific and agricultural research. \n

I spent the first month of my internship with a device called the CI-710, which was a handheld leaf 
spectrometer used for agricultural and scientific research. I spent about a month debugging an unstable
version of the code and prepared a release candidate for a new version of the software. \n

My second major project was creating a communications module for a gas detector. This was a custom 
instrument that a small team was building for a postharvest company. It was intended to differentiate 
concentrations of two similar chemicals used in controlling fruit ripening.\n

My job was to create a communication system that would store the data from the device on the cloud. 
I started with a BluesIO LTE module, which I used as an intermediary between the sensor board and a 
database. I learned how to use basic UART communications to pass JSON packets back and forth between the 
two boards, and I used BluesIO's built-in Notehub service to route data to AWS. \n
