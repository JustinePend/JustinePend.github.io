I took a physics lab class with two of my friends, and for our final project, we had the freedom to make whatever we wanted.
We wanted to do something with magnets, and eventually settled on 3D-printing a brushed motor. The most difficult part of this 
project was making the commutator, which is the piece of the motor that takes advantage of the shaft's rotation to switch the 
polarity of the electromagnet (and therefore the direction of the magnetic field). Our motor wasn't built to be particularly 
robust, it was more of a challenge to prove to ourselves that we could build a motor, but we did end up having an average RPM of 
around 1460 RPM, which was a lot better than we expected given the materials we were working with.
