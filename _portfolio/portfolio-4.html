I worked in the Trillium Lab at PSU for two summers during high school, where I worked on projects 
relating to using a drone for air quality monitoring. For the first part of the project, I used Python
to scrape the output of a Bluetooth air quality sensor (an Atmotube) and then tie those data points
to simulated GPS coordinates from a DJI Matrice 100 drone, which was controlled via ROS. I applied 
a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), which is an algorithm used in some machine learning applications, 
to interpolate between data points to generate a heatmap over the entire area. <br>
The second part of the project involved migrating hardware to a more portable form to mount the NVIDIA processor
on the drone itself. I could then apply autonomous control to the actual physical drone, which will enable more 
advanced control algorithms to be implemented in the future. <br>
