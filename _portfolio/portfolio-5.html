<p>
    I was in my high school robotics team for five years, during which I learned an incredible
    amount about robotics, teamwork, and leadership. A selection of the technichal projects I was 
    involved with include: <br>
</p>

- Swerve drive control and wiring <br>
- Autonomous routines that ran at the start of every match <br>
- Motion-profiling for use with complex arm mechanisms <br>
- Vision targeting and aiming for shooting games <br>
- Rapid troubleshooting (often interconnected) electrical and programming issues under 
pressure during competitions <br>

<p>
    I led the programming subteam and the electrical subteam starting in my freshman year, and 
    initially, most of my work revolved around getting the robot competition-ready, programming 
    robot-specific code, and testing autonomous routines. However, as I became a more senior member 
    of the team, I realized that an important part of my role was to pass on what I knew to younger 
    students so that the team could continue operating at a high level after I graduated.
</p>

<p>Most of our code was written in Kotlin (Java in 2017-- we switched languages), though some 
    smaller pieces such as vision were occasionally written in Python or C/C++. <br>
</p>

A good example of our robot code is our <a href="https://github.com/TeamMeanMachine/FRC2020">2020</a>
repository. <br>
The first two videos below are entirely autonomous. The third is a reveal video we filmed in 2018. <br>
