I'm currently working with a small team to make a maze-solving mouse robot for the IEEE club's Micromouse competition. 
We assembled and raced a pre-designed "rat" in fall to practice the basic format of the competition and gain familiarity 
with the processor. In winter, we designed and ordered our own custom PCB in Eagle, and we are currently in the process 
of assembling our mouse. I recently finished the maze-solving algorithm (floodfill) we will use for the main competition, 
a simulation of which is shown below (written in C).
